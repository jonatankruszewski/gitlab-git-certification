## Chapter 3: GitLab Components and Workflows

### Section: Development workflow in Gitlab

A GitFlow is a set of instructions or guidelines that prescribe how to utilize Git effectively and efficiently in order to achieve work in a consistent and productive way. GitLab Flow creates a seamless approach to software development by integrating a Git workflow with an issue tracking system.

#### Basic Git Workflow with GitLab

GitLab is based on Git and provides your team with a central repository. You use git locally on your own system to create and update code, share your changes with your team, and see your teamâ€™s changes by using git commands to push, fetch, and merge work. 

#### GitLab Workflow
 - Create an issue
 - Create a merge request
 - Commit changes
 - Ci Pipeline runs
 - Security checks
 - Review app
 - Discussion, code & security reviews
 - Approve changes
 - Merge, issue closed
 - CD Pipeline runs
 - Monitor the app

#### The gitlab flow: a simple workflow

Git is the standard. A GitFlow is a set of instructions or guidelines that prescribe how to utilize Git effectively and efficiently in order to achieve work in a consistent and productive way. 

Gitlab Flow creates a seamless approach to software development by integrating a Git workflow with an issue tracking system.

all features and fixes go to the main branch while enabling production and stable branches

- Branches die once merged
- addresses  multiple environments, releases, and integrations
- additional branches to our feature branches, that are ephemeral and lightweight.

#### Environment branches
- Master is in a staging state.
- Merge request from master to pre-production branch
- Merge request from pre-production to production branch


#### Release branches
- Only for releasing versioned software.
- Each branch is a minor version.
- Master works as staging.
- A release branches out from a commit and gets deployed.
- If patches need to be applied, they can be cherry-picked from master.
- New version? Branch out further down the road.

#### Branching Tips and Tricks.
There are some cases that you may want to hold a master and production branch. For example, when deployments are done in some window, or their timing need to be controlled.

### Section: GitLab components

#### GitLab Workflow components

- Project === repository
  - The core building block where work is organized, managed, tracked and delivered to help the team to collaborate and plan work in the form of issues.	 
- Group === project
  - A collection of projects and/or other groups. They are like folders.
- Issue === story, Narrative, Ticket
  - An issue is part of a project. It is the fundamental planning object where the team documents the use case in the description, discusses the approach, estimates the size/effort (issue weight), tracks actual time/effort, assigns work, and tracks progress.	
- Epic === initiatives, themes
  - A collection of related issues across different groups and projects to help organize by theme
- Merge request === pull request
- Milestone === sprint, iteration
  - The linkage between the issue and the actual code changes. Captures the design, implementation details (code changes), discussions (code reviews), approvals, testing (CI Pipeline), and security scans.
- Labels === tags
  - Used to tag and track work for a project or group and associate issues with different initiatives
- Board === kanban
  - A visual listing of projects and issues useful for teams to manage their backlog of work, prioritize items, and move issues to the team or specific stage in the project.
- Milestone === release
  - A sprint or deliverable(s), helping you organize code, issues, and merge requests into a cohesive group
- Roadmap
  - A visual representation of various epics for the group
-
